The Automotive_Industry has all the raw excel data. The data covers 2021â€“2025 and includes profit, quantity sold, dealer performance, recalls, customer sentiment, and environmental factors during sales (e.g., weather, temperature). Analysis was performed using Excel for data processing/pivots and Looker Studio for interactive dashboards and charts.

Analysis Approach Excel:
Used for data cleaning, pivot tables (e.g., sum of profit by model/year), and basic charts. Formulas calculated totals, averages, and trends. 

Looker Studio:
Connected to the Excel file for interactive visualizations. Created dashboards with filters for models, dealers, and years. Exported charts as images/PDF for sharing.
